 Granular Grief
################

Minecraft (1.12.2) Forge mod to specify exactly if and what creepers and
endermen are allowed to grief.

I wanted TNT, creepers and endermen to be dangerous and able to blow up some
parts of my bases, but not have the world outside look like swiss cheese.

The mod will create a config file with example settings when first run.

Quickstart
==========

Build Mod::

  gradle build


Test by running in minecraft client::

  gradle runClient
